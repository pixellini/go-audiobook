# go-audiobook

A Go-based tool for converting text files into high-quality audiobooks using text-to-speech technology.

## üìö Overview

This repository hosts a work-in-progress tool that transforms plain text and EPUB files into natural-sounding audiobooks using advanced TTS synthesis.

## üöß Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress** ‚Äì This project is still under active development. Functionality is incomplete, and things may break or change frequently.

### üõ†Ô∏è Feature List

- üó£Ô∏è Default speaker option  
- üìÑ Support for reading plain .txt files  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Concurrent TTS file generation for faster processing  
- üöÄ Enhanced Coqui integration, including GPU acceleration if available  
- üß† Coqui VITS support for quicker audiobook creation  
- üîÅ Automatic retries for failed paragraph TTS synthesis  
- üì¶ Containerise inside Docker  
- üéß MP3 output and conversion support  
- ‚è≥ Progress tracking with estimated time remaining  
- üåê Basic web interface (potentially using WASM)  

and of course... A better name than "go-audiobook" üòÑ

## üöÄ Getting Started

Instructions for installing and using this tool will be added once it's ready for public use.

### üì¶ Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies installed:

#### **[Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)**
Used for generating natural-sounding speech  

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install TTS
```

#### **[FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)**
Handles audio processing and conversion

On macOS (with Homebrew):

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### üé§ Providing a Narrator Voice (.wav)

You can customise your audiobook by providing a short audio sample of your chosen narrator's voice. This sample will be used as the voice for the entire audiobook, allowing you to generate content in any of the available languages. Coqui TTS synthesises speech using the unique vocal characteristics from the sample, not the spoken content.

- **Recommended length:** 1‚Äì3 minutes of clear, uninterrupted speech is usually enough for high-quality results. Samples longer than 3 minutes may increase processing time. If you have a powerful machine, you can experiment with longer inputs, but 3 minutes is sufficient for most cases. 
- **File format:** A `.wav` file is preferred for best audio quality. `.mp3` is also supported, and while it can speed up processing time, it may reduce quality.
- **Setup:** Place your audio file in the `speakers/` directory and update the `speaker_wav` path in your `config.json` accordingly.  

> **Note:** The spoken language in the sample doesn't affect the output. Coqui will synthesise your audiobook in the target language using the voice's characteristics from the sample.
